# DOMAIN DRIVEN DESIGN
Domain-driven design (DDD) is an approach to software development for 
complex needs by connecting the implementation to an evolving model.[1] 
The premise of domain-driven design is the following:

placing the project's primary focus on the core domain and domain logic;
basing complex designs on a model of the domain;
initiating a creative collaboration between technical and domain experts to iteratively refine a conceptual model that addresses particular domain problems.

##Context
The setting in which a word or statement appears that determines its meaning;
##Domain
A sphere of knowledge (ontology), influence, or activity. The subject area to which the user applies a program is the domain of the software;
##Model
A system of abstractions that describes selected aspects of a domain and can be used to solve problems related to that domain;
##Ubiquitous Language
A language structured around the domain model and used by all team members to connect all the activities of the team with the software.
