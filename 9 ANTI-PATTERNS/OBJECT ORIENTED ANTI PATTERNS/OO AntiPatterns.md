##object oriented:

#anemic domain model = domain model without business logic
#call super: require subclasses to call a superclassÂ´overridden method
#circle-ellipse problem + subtyping variable-types on the basis of value-subtypes
#circular-dependency:unecessary direct or indirect mutual dependencies
#constant interface =  using interface to define constants
#God object: to many functions in a single class
# object cesspool: reusing objects whose state does not conform to the contract of reuse
#object orgy: no encapsulation permitting unrestricted access to internals
#Poltergeists: objecs whose sole purpose is to pass information to objects
#sequential coupling: a class that requires its method to be called in particular order
#yo yo proble,: a structure that is hard to understand due to excessive fragmentation

SOLID
single responsablity = class method single purpos
open for extension/closed for modification
lyskov substitution principle
interface segregation specific interface rather then general abstract
depenceny inversion depend on abstration instead of general purpor concretion
