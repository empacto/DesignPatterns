#   softare anti patterns
#Accidental complexity: 
Programming tasks which could be eliminated with better tools (as opposed to essential complexity inherent in the problem being solved)
#Action at a distance: 
Unexpected interaction between widely separated parts of a system
#Boat anchor: 
Retaining a part of a system that no longer has any use
#Busy waiting: 
Consuming CPU while waiting for something to happen, usually by repeated checking instead of messaging
#Caching failure:
 Forgetting to clear a cache that holds a negative result (error) after the error condition has been corrected
#Cargo cult programming:
 Using patterns and methods without understanding why
#Coding by exception: 
Adding new code to handle each special case as it is recognized
#Design pattern: 
The use of patterns has itself been called an anti-pattern, a sign that a system is not employing enough abstraction[7]
#Error hiding: 
Catching an error message before it can be shown to the user and either showing nothing or showing a meaningless message. This anti-pattern is also named Diaper Pattern. Also can refer to erasing the Stack trace during exception handling, which can hamper debugging.
#Hard code: 
Embedding assumptions about the environment of a system in its implementation
#Lasagna code: 
Programs whose structure consists of too many layers of inheritance
#Lava flow: 
Retaining undesirable (redundant or low-quality) code because removing it is too expensive or has unpredictable consequences[8][9]
#Loop-switch sequence: 
Encoding a set of sequential steps using a switch within a loop statement
#Magic numbers: 
Including unexplained numbers in algorithms
#Magic strings: 
Implementing presumably unlikely input scenarios, such as comparisons with very specific strings, to mask functionality.
#Repeating yourself:
 Writing code which contains repetitive patterns and substrings over again; avoid with once and only once (abstraction principle)
#Shooting the messenger: 
Throwing exceptions from the scope of a plugin or subscriber in response to legitimate input, especially when this causes the outer scope to fail.

#Shotgun surgery:
 Developer adds features to an application codebase which span a multiplicity of implementors or implementations in a single change
#Soft code:
Storing business logic in configuration files rather than source code[10]

#Spaghetti code:
 Programs whose structure is barely comprehensible, especially because of misuse of code structures
