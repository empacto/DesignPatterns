## SOFTWARE DESIGN ANTI-PATTERNS
#Abstraction inversion:
 Not exposing implemented functionality required by callers of a function/method/constructor, so that the calling code awkwardly re-implements the same functionality in terms of those calls
#Ambiguous viewpoint:
 Presenting a model (usually Object-oriented analysis and design (OOAD)) without specifying its viewpoint
#Big ball of mud:
 A system with no recognizable structure
#Database-as-IPC:
 Using a database as the message queue for routine interprocess communication where a much more lightweight mechanism would be suitable
#Gold plating: 
Continuing to work on a task or project well past the point at which extra effort is not adding value
#Inner-platform effect:
 A system so customizable as to become a poor replica of the software development platform
#Input kludge: 
Failing to specify and implement the handling of possibly invalid input
#Interface bloat: 
Making an interface so powerful that it is extremely difficult to implement
#Magic pushbutton:
 A form with no dynamic validation or input assistance, such as dropdowns
#Race hazard:
 Failing to see the consequences of events that can sometimes interfere with each other
#Stovepipe system:
 A barely maintainable assemblage of ill-related components
